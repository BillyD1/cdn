# Adding HolaCDN hooks to your own player

If you use your own Flash based player (and not a one of the [supoported players] (https://github.com/hola/cdn/blob/master/install.md#2-add-hola-js-to-your-website)), you can use the code below to enable HolaCDN on your player. 

HolaCDN hooks are required for use with HolaCDN's JavaScript component. 

Note that the HolaCDN hooks do not affect the performance or functionality of your player. When the HolaCDN JavaScript is disabled, or not present on the page, your player will behave like it does without the hooks.

Choose your player and protocol from the list below: 

# HDS

* Your own player - use [HolaCDN OSMF] (https://github.com/hola/osmf)
* [VideoJS5] (https://github.com/hola/videojs5-osmf)

# HLS
* [FlashHLS] (https://github.com/hola/flashls)
* [Flowplayer] (https://github.com/hola/flowplayer-hlsjs)
* [VideoJS] (https://github.com/hola/videojs-contrib-hls)

# MP4
