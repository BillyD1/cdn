Hola also offers a commercial CDN service, specifically designed for video delivery. 

Hola client side code “auctions” each chunk of the video between the existing CDN and  multiple Hola CDN servers worldwide. First chunks are downloaded from the fastest servers and later chunks are downloaded from the lowest cost servers.  

Your video is played using chunks downloaded from multiple CDN servers, at high speed & reliability, with minimal cost. For more details, visit [the website] (http://www.holacdn.com)
